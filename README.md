# Bangalish2English_Speech-to-Speech-using-NLP

For converting Bangalish into English from both audio and
text sources, My strategy is 

1. Bangla Audio to Bangla Text
2. Bangla Text to English Text 
3. English Text to English Audio

which covers both audio and text conversion.

The best way would be if you run the "Bangalish_to_English.ipynb" file to google colab.
1. Open google colab in your browser.
2. Create a new notebook.
3. Import the "Bangalish_to_English.ipynb" file to your new notebook.
4. Import the "Bangalish.wav" file to your google colab file directory.
5. Before Running the code create a "output.mp3" to the same  google colab file directory. [This script will generate an MP3 file (output.mp3) with the spoken version of your translated text and play it using your default media player.]
6. Run the code and enjoy.

Same all 6 would be applied for "Nepalish_to_English.ipynb".

The code works 100%, if you need any kind of assistance you can mail me.
